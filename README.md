Repository containing the demo code for Real World Java 9.  

For more information about the talk (including slides, videos, and more detailed research) see [Real World Java 9](https://trishagee.com/presentations/real_world_java_9/).

### Branches
This has a slightly complicated set of branches, as it's a) a playground for a bunch of Java 9 features and b) has evolved as Java 9 has evolved.

**main** Fully working app. All services run, as does the UI. Uses Gradle 7.6, Java 17 and JavaFX 17.0.1. The UI only runs from the Gradle command line (not via IntelliJ IDEA's runner) via

    ./gradlew com.mechanitis.demo.sense.client:run

You can run this Gradle command inside IntelliJ IDEA and it will work. 

To demo the client you can run UserTestData and MoodTestData to create two stub services that output data for the client to read.

**broken-j9** this branch intentionally does not compile under Java 9, and shows the type of compilation errors you might expect to see when you first start using it.

**jigsaw** this is intentionally missing a module-info.java for com.mechanitis.demo.sense.flow. If you check out this branch you can play with creating one and fixing up errors.

**start-point** this is the state of the application before the demo.  The latest version now has a Maven/Gradle-like directory structure, but you can see earlier versions follow the OpenJDK structure.

**jbcnconf** shows a version of the completed application. This was designed to work with IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2 and Java 9 b176.

**qcon-london** the completed application as demoed at QCon London in March 2017.  This version of the presentation focused on migrating an application to use the Reactive Streams API from a custom messaging solution.  This worked with a much earlier version of Java 9 and may no longer compile.
